<p>I spent the end of the year refocusing. What questions are worth pursuing? Where are my talents uniquely suited? In the face of so many opportunities, finding a sense or purpose and direction becomes immensely important. How will I orient myself for the coming weeks, months, years?</p><p>I recalibrated my compass with a freewriting exercise. These are some excerpts:</p><p><p class="p1"><p class="p1"><span> </span>What will you do to change the world in 2013?</p></p><p class="p1"><span> </span>You have been pressed into service. Serve your community. Ask yourself: who will be best<span> </span>served by my talents today?</p></p><p><span> </span>Focus on the path. Make manifest the world as you have only dared to dream it.</p><p><p class="p1"><p class="p1"><span> </span>2012 was a year of reminders for me. The biggest: you can't take it with you. Find the ones<span> </span>you love. Say it. Mean it.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">I'll be writing more in the coming weeks. I won't be any less busy, but hope I can do a better job sharing what I'm working on and learning going forward.</p></p></p>
