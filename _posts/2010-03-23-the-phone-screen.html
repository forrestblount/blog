<div style="font-family:Arial;">A friend of mine was talking today about the process she's been going through to hire a direct report. &nbsp;As she talked about the phone screen process she's just been through, I realized there's a huge variation in what managers understand about the hiring process. &nbsp;That really shouldn't be that surprising as most managers don't hire very often so they don't get much practice. &nbsp;Brad Smart put's most manager's ability to hire A candidates at just 20% in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.topgrading.com/">Topgrading</a>.<br /><p /><div>Many organizations use phone screens to ascertain basic information to filter out some candidates. &nbsp;Criminal background, prior places of employment and other cursory topics may be discussed. &nbsp;What I think most organizations under utilize is the ability of the phone screen to begin the valuable and oft overlooked culture fit evaluation.</div><p /><div>I won't use this entry to convince you of the benefits of culture fit, but rather focus on the benefits of beginning the process with the first phone screen. &nbsp;Think about the last time you went on a blind date. &nbsp;How did you choose a neutral location to meet? &nbsp;What did you talk about over dinner?</div><p /><div>Now imagine you had the chance to call your date before deciding when and where to meet up. &nbsp;You got to know what kind of food they like, what neighborhoods they prefer, and even when they prefer to eat. &nbsp;This is the kind of information which seems trivial, but actually has tremendous value and impact on the long term nature of your relationship.</div><p /><div>It's also exactly the kind of information you can start to get during a phone screen.</div><p /><div>Try incorporating the following questions:</div><div>- What are you working on today?</div><div>- What are your best working hours?</div><div>- Do you prefer one on one or team based interviews?</div><p /><div>Like a date, once a candidate and hiring manager are in an interview together, they're both trying to impress the other. &nbsp;If either is underwhelmed, further advances will be rebuffed. &nbsp;Lastly, just like a date, if you can identify not just the right skills but also the right personality, you can find a partner who will make you and the rest of your team shine.</div><p /><div>What are your favorite phone screen questions?</div></div>
