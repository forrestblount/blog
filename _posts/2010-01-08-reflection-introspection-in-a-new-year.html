<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">      <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/23711234/What-Matters-Now">scribd.com</a></div>    <p>I'm aboard the MegaBus back to Boston from another Thursday night in NYC as we speak.  Before trying to get some sleep I thought I'd share this wonderful slideshow.  I truly think there's something that will speak to everyone here, so do yourself a favor and take a minute to read, reflect and introspect.</p></div>
