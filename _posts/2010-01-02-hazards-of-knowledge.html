We're between weeks three and four at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.founderinstitute.com/">Founder Institute</a>&nbsp;and I've been working my ass off. &nbsp;When I got accepted into the program, I planned that by our return from this short hiatus (we had two weeks off for the holidays) I'd have a working prototype. &nbsp;The trouble with my plan is that it didn't account for how much I'd learn during the first three sessions.<p /><div>Specifically, we learned about proper research and due diligence before leaping into product development. &nbsp;Yes, I had made one of the worst mistakes a startup can make: I'd leapt into development without doing my due diligence. &nbsp;Worse, the further I dug into the data, the less I felt I was on the right path. &nbsp;But the best part of the program is that a support network is built in. &nbsp;With the help of my working group and my newfound research data, I'm confident not only in my ability to spin up a new project for the program, but also that I'll be able to pivot successfully as the company develops through later stages.</div>
