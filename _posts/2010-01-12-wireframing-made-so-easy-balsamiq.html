I was up and running in seconds building mockups of my latest application.</p><p>In truth, I haven't used wireframes in the past.  As a single developer with no team, I've only occasionally sketched out designs before leaping into implementation.  I've always preferred fast iterations to a long and drawn out design process, but Balsamiq is easy enough for non-technical users to pull up, tweak and send on its way, not using it really would be a detriment to the final product.</p><p>It's free to check out, so if you're a developer interested in a better way to communicate ideas with designers, or just an entrepreneur looking for an easy way to explain your idea to others, Balsamiq is a great place to start.</p></div>
