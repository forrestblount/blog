<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">      <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://capitalize.dartboston.com/capitalize-live-riotvine-at-venrock/">capitalize.dartboston.com</a></div>    <p>Spent some time today watching the first two episodes, both are highly informative for completely different reasons.  Best lessons from each:</p><p>ep 1: Focus on team building and cold start problem</p><p>ep 2: How and When to Pitch (Hot Seats are your friend!)</p><p>Best luck to @RiotVine and @RatingWorld!</p></div>
