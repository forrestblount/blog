<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><blockquote><div><p>Eliminating waste is the fundamental principle of lean thinking.</p><p>As defined by Womak/Jones in their book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743249275?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ashmau-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743249275">&ldquo;Lean Thinking&rdquo;</a> (a must-read):</p><blockquote><p>Waste is any human activity which absorbs resources but creates no value.</p></blockquote><p>Of all resources, there is no resource more valuable than time. Time is more valuable than money. While money can fluctuate up or down, time only moves in one direction &ndash; down.</p><p>Another way in which the value of time shows up for lean startups is through <a href="https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000788.html">Boyd&rsquo;s Law</a> which states that:</p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Speed of iterations beats quality of iteration.</p></blockquote><p>Colonel John Boyd, a military strategist and Air Force fighter, found this by studying an anomaly in dogfights where an inferior aircraft (F-86) consistently beat a superior aircraft (MiG-15) because it was able to iterate faster thanks to a hydraulic versus manual flight stick. Eric Ries applies Boyd&rsquo;s Law to lean startups by highlighting the importance of maximizing cycle time through the  build/measure/learn loop.</p><p><img title="buildmeasurelearn" src="https://www.ashmaurya.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/buildmeasurelearn.jpg" height="300" alt="buildmeasurelearn" width="300" /></p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Startups that succeed are those that manage to iterate enough times before running out of resources. Time between these iterations is fundamental.</p></blockquote></div></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="https://www.ashmaurya.com/2009/12/achieving-flow-in-a-lean-startup/">ashmaurya.com</a></div><p>This article isn't 100% original, but gives credit where credit is due.  I've read "Flow" which I found to be eye-opening, but this articles takes the wonderful leap into constructing a meaningful founder's schedule around the same concepts.  I highly recommend reading it in its entirety and following Ash Maurya's future posts.</p><p>I found this post from Eric Ries blog, which has a lot of other great resources for startups <a href="https://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/01/amazing-lean-startup-resources.html">https://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/01/amazing-lean-startup-resources.html</a></p></div>
